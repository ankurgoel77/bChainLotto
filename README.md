## Capstone project for FinTech Bootcamp  
#### by Quang Le, Jordan Hickerson, Ankur Goel

# Introduction and Purpose
When playing games online, it's hard to know if your opponent is cheating. During a game of chess, you opponent may be using chess software to plan his moves. In a game of online poker, your opponent may be collaborating with the website owner to know your cards in advance, or to be dealt favorable cards. It is simply too easy to be scammed online without sufficient safeguards.  

Blockchain technology could be a way of solving many of these issues. Blockchains that are (1) Open, (2) Public, and (3) Neutral will offer verifiable and transparent receipts of each transaction because both the code and records can be made examined in real-time.  

This project will examine 2 different "Games of Chance" to see how we can implement smart contracts on the Ethereum network, and show how to provide open and public gambling games.

Group responsibilities were as follows:  
* Setting up a public Ganache Testnet - Ankur
* Implementing and Testing a Lotto Smart Contract in Remix - Jordan and Ankur
* Implementing both Deployer and Player Lotto UI in Python - Jordan
* Analyzing Lotto Numbers - Quang
* Implementing BlackJack Smart Contract in Remix - Ankur
* Implement Web UI for BlackJack - Ankur
